### B. Expected usage level

#### B.1. Frequency
Given that the emoji is primarily present in private contexts it’s hard to estimate how it has been used and will be used. As such we have chosen to compare its search frequency with the terms “worried emoji” and “stressed emoji”.

#### B.1.a. Google Search

#### B.1.b. Bing Search

#### B.1.c. Google Video Search

#### B.1.d. Google Trends: Web Search

#### B.2. Multiple usages
TODO: Show example usages of MILDLY PANICKED FACE.
"Just submitted my first emoji proposal to the Unicode Consortium ."

#### B.3. Use in sequences
TODO: Come up with reasonable sequence usages of MILDLY PANICKED FACE.

#### B.4. Breaking new ground
TODO: Provide arguments.

### C. Distinctiveness
MILDLY PANICKED FACE is visually distinct from existing emoji, especially within its category.

### D. Completeness
TODO: Provide arguments.
MILDLY PANICKED FACE allows for an expression of concern not currently possible with existing emoji.

### E. Petitions or “frequent requests”
TODO: There are a few change.org petitions to add mild panic, but I haven’t been able to get their numbers. Twitter has plenty of requests to add “mild panic” both to specific services and to Unicode.

## Selection Factors – Exclusion

### F. Overly specific
TODO: Write arguments

### G. Open-ended
TODO: Write arguments

### H. Already representable
There are already several emojis in the “face-concered” category, but none that features a forced smile. The closest current approximation is ANXIOUS FACE WITH SWEAT or a FLUSHED FACE followed by a DROPLET. 

### I. Logos, brands, UI icons, signage, specific people, specific landmarks, deities
MILDLY PANICKED FACE is not a logo, brand, or UI icon. It is not part of signage, it does not depict specific people or landmarks, nor does it reference or depict and deity.

### J. Transient
The emotions expressed by MILDLY PANICKED FACE are presumed to be enduring.

### K. Faulty comparison
TODO: Write arguments

### L. Exact Images
MILDLY PANICKED FACE is not meant to be an exact image.

### M. Region Flags Without Code
Not applicable.
