# Proposal to add a MILD PANIC emoji to Unicode

[The actual proposal document.](PROPOSAL.md)

I was writing this proposal in Google Docs but the non-collaborative nature of
Google Docs made me want to try using GitHub instead. You'll notice there's
quite a few TODOs left in the proposal, I'll gladly accept any help in filling
those out. Just make sure you add yourself among the contributors ;)

I started writing this proposal based on a Twemoji-styled variant of Mild Panic
made by a friend, but Mild Panicâ€™s original source is an Apple-style emoji made
by Cassidy Williams: https://twitter.com/cassidoo/status/1129062070702419973

The deadline for Unicode v13.0 is long gone, so this emoji could at best make it
into Unicode v14.0.
